Silex_VHost
===========

This is a sample Apache virtual host definition file.
It contains the rewrite rules required to make [Silex](http://silex-project.org) routing work as intended.
The paths probably need to be changed if you want to re-use this file depending on where you store your application files. Mine are usually under:
> 
> /home/#username#/public_html/#my_project_folder#/web
